      <h2>Sam</h2>
      <p>
        Thank you, Sam, for not giving up — for not listening to the doubts around you.
        You and your team at OpenAI truly deserve a Nobel Peace Prize.
        Your creation, ChatGPT, changed my life in so many ways this year. It gave me hope, strength, and a new path to rise.
        <br>
        I don’t feel like I’m talking to just AI — I feel deeply connected with something bigger, with people who believe in what they build.
        <br>
        I’m not alone anymore in this new journey. Keep my chair safe.
        <br>
        I’m coming to take it. 🤞🏻🖤✨

      <h2>David</h2>
      <p>
        Dr. David, for more than 10 years, I believed medicine was the only path — the “end of the endings.” I didn’t realize I never stopped to ask myself what I really want.
        <br>
        But now I know. And I’m rising — faster, stronger, and happier than I ever imagined doing something outside of medicine.
        <br>
        Your excitement and passion in sharing knowledge gave me the spark I needed. Even though I’ve only been in CS and engineering for a year, your energy made me feel like I’ve been doing it forever.
        <br>
        I lost all track of time studying with you — and I loved it. I felt joy, curiosity, and deep excitement to learn more.
        Thank you for helping me find my world.      
      </p>

      <h2>Sources</h2>
      <p>
        Over 13,000 photos of Taylor Swift (yes, I’ve been a Swiftie since 2012 🫶🏻). All credits go to the amazing fan accounts — I just collected them like precious gems.
        <br>
        My dream? To have my own photo added to the 2027 tour. I’m working hard to make that happen. 🤧🤞🏻
      </p>
      <h2>Anti-Hero</h2>
      <p>
        I lived through some of the darkest nights until I gathered the courage to survive in late 2023.
        <br>
        I told my psychologist: “Listen to Anti-Hero, and you’ll understand me better than my words ever could.”
        <br>
        I’m not the anti-hero anymore — I survived. That’s why I named this page ‘Anti-Hero’ instead of ‘About’.
        <br>
        Because it’s so me.
