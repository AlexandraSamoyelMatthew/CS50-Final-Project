                        Taylor said she wished to release another album and go on a world tour. Well, she did and won five Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year. “You Belong with Me” and “Love Story” became chart-topping hits and everyone still sings them. Let’s not forget the two claps in the middle. Since then, I’ve been living Taylor’s songs as a part of my life.

                        Taylor has always responded to criticism with action. When Fearless was a hit, people said she couldn't write her own songs. She didn't respond to them verbally or directly.

                    Taylor's growing up phase has become something she loves to document in her songs, all the moments, all the feelings and thoughts. The album "Reed" expresses the sadness and heartbreak of the person you love from your heart and trust, but he lets you down, makes light of your feelings and even forgets your birthday because he was busy! Taylor was able to explain the pain in all the parts you feel or don't notice, but the album "Reed" was the end of her career in country music.
