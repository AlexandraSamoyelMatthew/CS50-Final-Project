## 🌟 Project Title
**Taylor Swift Tribute Web — "A swiftie's Passion"**

## 📖 Description
This is a personal, artistic, and interactive tribute to Taylor Swift — designed as a multi-page website capturing the spirit of her eras, music, and storytelling.  
It includes animations, transitions, and visual effects using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

The main pages include:
- A **carousel landing page** inspired by Taylor's iconic albums.
- A **tours page** showing the journey across Swift’s eras.
- Extra features such as fading transitions, and responsive layouts.

This project is a mix of inspiration from tutorials and my own imagination. I tried to express not just technical skills, but emotion, mood, and nostalgia.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- HTML5 – for page structure
- CSS3 – for styling, layout, and responsive design
- JavaScript – for interactive elements (used on selected pages)

## 💡 Inspiration & Acknowledgments
- The **carousel idea** was inspired by a tutorial from [Lun Dev Code Channel], which helped me understand how to structure an album-style slider. I customized the code and added my own design and animations.
- The **tours/slides section** was based on a layout idea from a tutorial by [Skillthrive Channel], which I adapted to match the Taylor Swift Eras theme.

Note: I only took inspiration from the structure — all styling, content, transitions, and additional features were fully created by me.
